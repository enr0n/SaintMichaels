NOTE THE FOLLOWING BEFORE USING TEMPLATES:

(1) Templates with the suffix '-random' are problems with randomly generated
    values. They will compile as they are, without any additional input
    from the instructor.

(2) All other templates require input from the instructor.
    e.g.) The matrix in which the student must compute the determinant for.
    However, they are parameterized so that no additional work is needed.
