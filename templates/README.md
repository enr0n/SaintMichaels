NOTE THE FOLLOWING BEFORE USING TEMPLATES:

(1) Templates with the suffix '-random' are problems with randomly generated
    values. They will compile as they are, without any additional input
    from the instructor.

(2) All other templates require input from the instructor.
    e.g.) The matrix in which the student must compute the determinant for.
    However, they are parameterized so that no additional work is needed.

(3) There are templates for questions that are essentially the same, but framed 
    in different ways.
    e.g.) determinants.pg and determinants-volume.pg each require the student to
    compute a determinant, but the questions are framed differently.

(4) If there is a template for a question you want to use, but want to ask it in 
    a different way (3), it should be sufficient to edit the code in TEXT SECTION.
