determinants: 
	Student must compute the determinant of a given matrix.
	
    Input:
		-3x column vectors

singularity:
	Asks the student to determine the singularity of the matrix,
	and justify the answer by giving the determinant.
	
	Input:
		-3x column vectors

volume:
	Student must compute the volume of the region bounded 
    by the given vectors.

	Input:
		-3x column vectors

NOTE: Working randomized versions exist for each of these problems.
